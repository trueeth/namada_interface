Development
===========

Release procedure
-----------------
A new release can be created by manually running the CI workflow 'Deploy
interface and release extension'. This deploys the interface to namada.me and
creates a new GitHub release with downloads of the extension. This can be used
to set environment parameters such as the Namada chain ID.
